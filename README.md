This repository contains all the codde used for generating results while writing "Matematiska modeller för smittspridning av
covid-19". 

Most of the code is written to run without any setup (except potentially missing libraries). 
The full written report can be found aswell in the repository

Main files to run:
- **Mobility_based_SIR_daily.ipynb**\n
- **Mobility_based_SIR_weekly.ipynb**,
- **Plotting_modell_results.ipynb**
